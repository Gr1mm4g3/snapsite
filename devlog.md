# Snapsite Devlog

## Project Overview
Snapsite is a web application that converts screenshots into clean, responsive websites using AI. This document tracks the development progress, decisions, and updates. No content should be removed from this document at any point. Content can only be added to this document. Only the Next steps section can be updated as need be.

## 2025-07-14 - Initial Setup and UI Development

### Core Features Implemented
- **Theme System**
  - Implemented light/dark mode with a theme switcher
  - Created a custom ThemeContext for state management
  - Added smooth transitions between themes
  - Persisted theme preference in localStorage

### UI Components
- **Header**
  - Responsive navigation bar
  - Theme switcher with sun/moon icons
  - Clean, modern design with subtle animations

- **Home Page**
  - Hero section with drag-and-drop file upload
  - Feature highlights with icons
  - Call-to-action section
  - Responsive grid layout

- **Footer**
  - Copyright information
  - Navigation links (Privacy, Terms, Contact)
  - Personal signature with code and heart icons

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**
  - Built with Next.js 14 and React 18
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Component-based architecture

- **State Management**
  - React Context for theme management
  - Local state for UI interactions

- **Authentication**
  - Integrated Clerk for user authentication
  - Protected routes and user management

### Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**
  - Primary: Cyan (#06b6d4)
  - Secondary: Magenta (#d946ef)
  - Dark mode with proper contrast ratios
  - Accessible color combinations

- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Responsive typography and spacing
  - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Theme Toggling**
   - Issue: Initial implementation had flickering on page load
   - Solution: Added a mounted state to prevent hydration mismatches

2. **Component Organization**
   - Issue: Large components were becoming hard to maintain
   - Solution: Split into smaller, reusable components with clear responsibilities

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement file upload functionality
- [ ] Add AI processing pipeline
- [ ] Create results page with generated code preview
- [ ] Add user authentication flows
- [ ] Implement code export functionality
