# Snapsite Devlog

## Project Overview
Snapsite is a web application that converts screenshots into clean, responsive websites using AI. This document tracks the development progress, decisions, and updates. No content should be removed from this document at any point. Content can only be added to this document. Only the Next steps section can be updated as need be.

## 2025-07-14 - Initial Setup and UI Development

### Core Features Implemented
- **Theme System**
  - Implemented light/dark mode with a theme switcher
  - Created a custom ThemeContext for state management
  - Added smooth transitions between themes
  - Persisted theme preference in localStorage

### UI Components
- **Header**
  - Responsive navigation bar
  - Theme switcher with sun/moon icons
  - Clean, modern design with subtle animations

- **Home Page**
  - Hero section with drag-and-drop file upload
  - Feature highlights with icons
  - Call-to-action section
  - Responsive grid layout

- **Footer**
  - Copyright information
  - Navigation links (Privacy, Terms, Contact)
  - Personal signature with code and heart icons

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**
  - Built with Next.js 14 and React 18
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Component-based architecture

- **State Management**
  - React Context for theme management
  - Local state for UI interactions

- **Authentication**
  - Integrated Clerk for user authentication
  - Protected routes and user management

### Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**
  - Primary: Cyan (#06b6d4)
  - Secondary: Magenta (#d946ef)
  - Dark mode with proper contrast ratios
  - Accessible color combinations

- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Responsive typography and spacing
  - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Theme Toggling**
   - Issue: Initial implementation had flickering on page load
   - Solution: Added a mounted state to prevent hydration mismatches

2. **Component Organization**
   - Issue: Large components were becoming hard to maintain
   - Solution: Split into smaller, reusable components with clear responsibilities

## 2025-07-14 - Editor Page Implementation

### Core Features Implemented
- **Editor Page**
  - Created dynamic route for image editing at `/editor/[id]`
  - Implemented secure file access with user authentication
  - Added image preview with loading and error states
  - Set up basic image editing controls (brightness, contrast, saturation)
  - Added file information display with upload timestamp

- **Authentication & Security**
  - Implemented protected routes with Clerk middleware
  - Added user-specific file access control
  - Set up proper error handling for missing or unauthorized files
  - Added redirects for unauthenticated users

- **UI/UX Improvements**
  - Added loading skeletons for better perceived performance
  - Implemented responsive layout for editor controls
  - Added error boundaries for graceful error handling
  - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**
  - Used Next.js 15 with App Router
  - Implemented client-side image validation
  - Added TypeScript types for better code reliability
  - Used shadcn/ui components for consistent UI

- **State Management**
  - Local state for UI interactions
  - URL-based state for sharing editable links
  - Loading and error states for better UX

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Params Access in Next.js 15**
   - Issue: Warnings about direct params access in Next.js 15
   - Solution: Updated to use `useParams()` hook for proper param handling

2. **File Extension Handling**
   - Issue: Mismatch between uploaded file extensions and expected paths
   - Solution: Updated file path construction to match actual uploaded file extensions

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Issue: Redirect loops and auth state management
   - Solution: Implemented proper auth checks with loading states

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement AI-powered image enhancement
- [ ] Add more advanced editing tools
- [ ] Create a sharing system for edited images
- [ ] Add support for multiple file formats
- [ ] Implement image versioning and history
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## 2025-07-14 - File Upload & Authentication Implementation

### Core Features Implemented
- **File Upload System**
  - Created secure file upload API endpoint
  - Implemented user-specific file storage
  - Added file type validation for images
  - Generated unique filenames with timestamps
  - Set up public URL generation for uploaded files

- **Authentication Flow**
  - Integrated Clerk middleware for route protection
  - Implemented secure session management
  - Added user-specific file isolation
  - Set up proper error handling for unauthenticated requests

- **Frontend Integration**
  - Created file upload component with drag-and-drop
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Implemented file type validation in the UI
  - Added success/error feedback for users

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**
  - Created `/api/upload` endpoint with Next.js 13+ App Router
  - Implemented multipart form data parsing
  - Added file system operations with Node.js `fs` module
  - Set up proper error handling and logging

- **Security**
  - All API routes protected by Clerk authentication
  - File uploads restricted to authenticated users
  - User directories isolated by user ID
  - File type validation on both client and server

- **Performance**
  - Asynchronous file operations
  - Efficient memory usage with streams
  - Proper cleanup of temporary files

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Issue: Middleware wasn't properly passing user context to API routes
   - Solution: Implemented custom header passing and session verification

2. **File Upload Handling**
   - Issue: Next.js body parser conflicts with file uploads
   - Solution: Disabled default body parser and implemented custom form data handling

3. **User Isolation**
   - Issue: Files needed to be scoped to individual users
   - Solution: Created user-specific directories using Clerk's user ID

## 2025-07-14 - Project Initialization
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
- Added basic project structure
- Set up Git repository
