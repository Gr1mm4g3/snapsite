# Snapsite Devlog

## Project Overview
Snapsite is a web application that converts screenshots into clean, responsive websites using AI. This document tracks the development progress, decisions, and updates. No content should be removed from this document at any point. Content can only be added to this document. Only the Next steps section can be updated as need be.

## 2025-07-14 - Initial Setup and UI Development

### Core Features Implemented
- **Theme System**
  - Implemented light/dark mode with a theme switcher
  - Created a custom ThemeContext for state management
  - Added smooth transitions between themes
  - Persisted theme preference in localStorage

### UI Components
- **Header**
  - Responsive navigation bar
  - Theme switcher with sun/moon icons
  - Clean, modern design with subtle animations

- **Home Page**
  - Hero section with drag-and-drop file upload
  - Feature highlights with icons
  - Call-to-action section
  - Responsive grid layout

- **Footer**
  - Copyright information
  - Navigation links (Privacy, Terms, Contact)
  - Personal signature with code and heart icons

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**
  - Built with Next.js 14 and React 18
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Component-based architecture

- **State Management**
  - React Context for theme management
  - Local state for UI interactions

- **Authentication**
  - Integrated Clerk for user authentication
  - Protected routes and user management

### Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**
  - Primary: Cyan (#06b6d4)
  - Secondary: Magenta (#d946ef)
  - Dark mode with proper contrast ratios
  - Accessible color combinations

- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Responsive typography and spacing
  - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Theme Toggling**
   - Issue: Initial implementation had flickering on page load
   - Solution: Added a mounted state to prevent hydration mismatches

2. **Component Organization**
   - Issue: Large components were becoming hard to maintain
   - Solution: Split into smaller, reusable components with clear responsibilities

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement file upload functionality
- [ ] Add AI processing pipeline
- [ ] Create results page with generated code preview
- [ ] Add user authentication flows
- [ ] Implement code export functionality

## 2025-07-14 - File Upload & Authentication Implementation

### Core Features Implemented
- **File Upload System**
  - Created secure file upload API endpoint
  - Implemented user-specific file storage
  - Added file type validation for images
  - Generated unique filenames with timestamps
  - Set up public URL generation for uploaded files

- **Authentication Flow**
  - Integrated Clerk middleware for route protection
  - Implemented secure session management
  - Added user-specific file isolation
  - Set up proper error handling for unauthenticated requests

- **Frontend Integration**
  - Created file upload component with drag-and-drop
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Implemented file type validation in the UI
  - Added success/error feedback for users

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**
  - Created `/api/upload` endpoint with Next.js 13+ App Router
  - Implemented multipart form data parsing
  - Added file system operations with Node.js `fs` module
  - Set up proper error handling and logging

- **Security**
  - All API routes protected by Clerk authentication
  - File uploads restricted to authenticated users
  - User directories isolated by user ID
  - File type validation on both client and server

- **Performance**
  - Asynchronous file operations
  - Efficient memory usage with streams
  - Proper cleanup of temporary files

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Issue: Middleware wasn't properly passing user context to API routes
   - Solution: Implemented custom header passing and session verification

2. **File Upload Handling**
   - Issue: Next.js body parser conflicts with file uploads
   - Solution: Disabled default body parser and implemented custom form data handling

3. **User Isolation**
   - Issue: Files needed to be scoped to individual users
   - Solution: Created user-specific directories using Clerk's user ID

## 2025-07-14 - Project Initialization
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
- Added basic project structure
- Set up Git repository
